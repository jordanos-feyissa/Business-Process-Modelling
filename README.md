This project consists on elaborating a business process for a parking permit
renewal, were we specifically focus on the scenario of of a citizen who wants
to renew his parking permit for her/his residence zone. The citizen contacts
the municipal office to ask information and gets a list of forms to be filled and
of documents to prepare. Once the citizen has delivered all documents and
forms, an office worker checks them carefully and takes one of the following
decisions: to release the permit, to revoke the permit, to ask for missing
information (e.g., further documents) or to ask for the revision of some forms
(e.g., because they were not properly filled). The delivery of documents and
their analysis can take place for any number of times, until the parking
permit is released to the citizen or it is revoked. To transform this task into
a process it is mainly focused on BPMN graphical notation for visualization
and documentation of the business process while for the analysis it is relied
on the Petri net in order to model and analyze the workflow.
